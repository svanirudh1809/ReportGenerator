# Report Generator Tool

Welcome to the Report Generator tool project! This is a Python-based application that automates the process of generating PDF reports by filling in values from a text file into a template HTML file. With this tool, you can easily create professional-looking reports from your data without the need for manual formatting or editing.     

## Overview

This can be used to seamlessly integrate into your application as a python project or an executable file. The tool (currently) takes a HTML file as input containing the report format filled with the keyword ***@%*** followed by a number (Eg: @%1, @%2, ..). And output is a pdf file with filled in values from the text file.  

## Features

- **Automated Report Generation**: Automatically generate PDF reports by filling in values from a text file into a template HTML file.
- **Customizable Templates**: Use your own HTML templates created with MS Word or other editors to customize the layout and styling of the generated reports.
- **Data-driven**: Populate reports with data stored in a text file, where each value is assigned a key corresponding to its position in the template.
- **Save and Export**: Save the generated PDF reports to your local system for easy access and sharing.  

> ## Future Directions  
> - Accept multiple input formats (pdf. word. html etc.)
> - Give a direct access to open template file and data file in the application to work as a standalone gui
